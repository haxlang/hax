.SH NAME
Hax_Backslash \- parse a backslash sequence
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <hax.h>\fR
.sp
char
\fBHax_Backslash\fR(\fIsrc, countPtr\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS char *countPtr
.AP char *src in
Pointer to a string starting with a backslash.
.AP int *countPtr out
If \fIcountPtr\fR isn't NULL, \fI*countPtr\fR gets filled
in with number of characters in the backslash sequence, including
the backslash character.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is a utility procedure used by several of the Hax
commands.  It parses a backslash sequence and returns
the single character corresponding to the sequence.
.VS
If the backslash sequence should be replaced by no character
at all (e.g. backslash-newline) then \fBHax_Backslash\fR returns 0.
.VE
\fBHax_Backslash\fR modifies \fI*countPtr\fR to contain the number
of characters in the backslash sequence.
If \fIsrc\fR doesn't point to a backslash
sequence understood by Hax, then Hax_Backslash returns a backslash
as its result and \fI*countPtr\fR gets set to 1 (in this case the
backslash character should not get any special treatment).
.PP
See the Hax manual entry for information on the valid
backslash sequences.
.VS
All of the sequences described in the Hax
manual entry are supported by \fBHax_Backslash\fR.
.VE

.SH KEYWORDS
backslash, parse
